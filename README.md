# CLIMathUtils
CLIMathUtils (CLMU) is a set of command-line math utilities for linux and windows developed in Fortran and C

CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute functions directly at the Shell (BASH) prompt.
CLIMathUtils (CLMU) is a set of math routines that use the command-line interface to get input data. This data can come directly from the command line or from specially formatted files like CSV files, for example.
This is a work in constant development and, as new utilities are developed, they will be immediately available in this repository.
